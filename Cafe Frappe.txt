This café frappé recipe is the perfect way to treat your guests – around the swimming pool, why not?! – to an extra-special, tasty drink surprisingly low in calories.

But nothing’s stopping you from getting creative and adding your own special ingredients to make it even more indulgent: a scoop of ice cream (how about vanilla or coffee?), whipped cream, chocolate sauce… I’ll leave the rest to your imagination!

I look forward to seeing the photos of your own creations!!
